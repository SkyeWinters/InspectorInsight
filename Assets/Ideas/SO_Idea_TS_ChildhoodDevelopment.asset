  Hint: "There's something about a kid on stage\u2026 acting out someone else\u2019s
    life. It does more than entertain; it molds them, shapes their view of the world."
  Description: Studies say bringing theatre to young minds opens doors in their heads,
    teaches them to see from another's eyes. Acting is more than just playing a part;
    it's learning empathy, one scene at a time.
