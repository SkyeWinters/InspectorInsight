  Hint: "Something about social equality and the cost of these lenses\u2026 If I
    link those, I might understand how they could split society."
  Description: I see it now... A divide between those who can afford the future and
    those stuck in the past. The lenses aren't just tech; they're status, a new line
    in the sand. The gap grows wider.
