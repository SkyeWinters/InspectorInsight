  Hint: "Props and virtual reality\u2026 something about those two together could
    change the whole stage, make what\u2019s not there feel real."
  Description: "Yes! That\u2019s how they could do it, AR could turn imagination
    into reality. A stage where props appear from thin air, where costumes burst
    with color and light. They don\u2019t need to build it; they just need you to
    see it."
