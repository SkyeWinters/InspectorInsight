  Hint: "Digital companions and virtual sets\u2026 something there feels connected,
    like the cast could grow beyond what\u2019s real."
  Description: "That's the angle! Virtual actors sharing the stage with the real
    ones, expanding the cast beyond flesh and bone. The audience wouldn't know who's
    real and who\u2019s not\u2026 a new twist on the old play."
