  Hint: "What if I connect the power of a story with how people start to feel more?
    There\u2019s got to be something in that."
  Description: "Of course! It\u2019s not the words, it\u2019s the experience. When
    people watch a story live, they feel it in their bones. The stage takes empathy
    to a level books can\u2019t reach\u2014it makes strangers' lives feel like their
    own."
