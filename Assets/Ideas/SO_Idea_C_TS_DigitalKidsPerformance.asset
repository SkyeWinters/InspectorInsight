  Hint: "There\u2019s a link between reaching the kids and virtual performances\u2026
    maybe bringing the theatre to them could make all the difference."
  Description: I've got it! Bring the stage to the schools, not the other way around.
    AR makes every gym a theatre, every kid an audience. Expand the reach, plant
    the seeds of imagination early on.
