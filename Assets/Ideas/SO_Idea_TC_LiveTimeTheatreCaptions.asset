  Hint: If I think about dialogue and live captions together... could it be a way
    to make theatre more accessible, more inclusive?
  Description: "Got it! Captions in real-time, not just for the audience, but for
    the performers too. A way to bridge gaps, to make sure everyone\u2014no matter
    who they are\u2014gets the full picture. The theatre becomes a space for everyone."
