  Hint: "Actors and body language\u2026 Maybe if the lenses could teach the actors
    to speak without words, there\u2019s something in that."
  Description: Aha! The lenses could refine every gesture, every glance. Actors wouldn't
    just say their lines; they'd live them, make every move speak volumes. A new
    kind of performance, where silence says it all.
